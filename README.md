# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio page, meant to showcase all of the projects I have created throughout my time in coding bootcamp. It is not meant to showcase only the best projects I have created, but to show the progression of my skills throughout this course. I will not be going back and updating older projects (besdies this one, where I will continue to add the projects I have created as the course moves forward). The focus of this project is to apply core skills learned throughout the second week of bootcamp, which include flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Many of the web applications displayed in this page will be, at first, placeholders, for projects yet to come

I am highly motivated to break into this indsutry, and hope that this portfolio not only shows my ability to learn and adapt, but also to present the skills that I have developed to potential employers looking to fill part-time or full-time roles.
